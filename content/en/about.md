We are a cross-functional team of three employees—founded by **Robin Temme**—working with a growing network of specialists. Together we help tech teams untangle complex systems, make software maintainable, and run infrastructure with confidence—with clear structure, solid documentation, and modern tooling.

Our stack runs deep and our mindset stays pragmatic: We build scalable backend systems in Go & Python, automate deployments with Kubernetes & GitLab CI, and ship reliably to production.
What we don’t do: half-baked workarounds, blind hype cycles, or code no one understands three months later.

Whether with enterprises or mid-sized companies, we’re often brought in when projects stall or when things get serious. We bring structure, create trust, and act as the social glue in the team—not just the tech folks.

If you need a solution that’s still stable a year from now, [**let’s talk.**]({{< relref "contact.md" >}})
