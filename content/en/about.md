Hi, I'm **Robin** – founder and managing director of **Temme Cloud & Tech GmbH**.

I help international tech teams untangle complex systems, make software maintainable, and get infrastructure under control – without drama, but with clear structure, clean documentation, and modern tools.

My stack is deep, my mindset pragmatic: I build scalable backend systems in Go & Python, automate deployments with Kubernetes & GitLab CI, and reliably bring things into production.
What I don't do: half-baked workarounds, blind hype, or code that no one understands in three months.

Whether in corporations or medium-sized businesses – I'm often brought in when projects are technically stuck or when things get serious. I bring structure, build trust, and I'm not just the techie, but also the social glue in the team.

If you need a solution that will still be stable in a year – [**let's talk.**](../contact)
