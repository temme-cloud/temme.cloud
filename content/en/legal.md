## Disclaimer

### Liability for Content

The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to general laws pursuant to § 7 para. 1 DDG. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.

### Liability for Links

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright

The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Contributions from third parties are marked as such. Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation beyond the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.
