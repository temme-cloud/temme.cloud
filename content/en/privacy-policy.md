For structured handling of requests, the email is automatically forwarded to GitLab Service Desk (GitLab.com), where a confidential ticket/issue is created with the content of the inquiry.

**Confidentiality:** Service Desk tickets are confidential by default. We ensure organisationally that tickets are not inadvertently made public and that access rights are restrictively assigned.
