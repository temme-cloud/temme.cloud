## Liability disclaimer

### Liability for content

The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages under general law pursuant to § 7 Abs. 1 DDG. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. Liability in this respect is only possible from the time we become aware of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content without delay.

### Liability for links

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no control. We therefore cannot accept any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not identifiable at the time of linking. Permanent monitoring of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. If we become aware of legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright

The content and works created by the website operators are subject to German copyright law. Contributions by third parties are identified as such. Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are permitted for private, non-commercial use only.
